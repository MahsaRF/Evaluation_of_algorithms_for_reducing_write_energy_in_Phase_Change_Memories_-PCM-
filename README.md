# Evaluation of algorithms for reducing write energy in Phase Change Memories (PCM)

Topic : Evaluation of algorithms for reducing write energy in Phase Change Memories(PCM)
Definition :

One of the most important issue in Main Memories is the potential of scalability, and 
scalability of PCM against DRAM has considerable preference causes PCM has become topic 
issue in scalability and DRAM has proven less attractive from the point of view of scaling. Versus 
this advantage, high energy consumption especially in write operations is inappropriate. In this 
circumstance, Methods based on assessment are proposed and the most of them using 
comparison before writing the data word. In these methods according to proportion of read 
energy consumption to write energy consumption decrease the number of writes in each block 
or word and these methods will increase read operations in PCM for 
comparison.

We presented some techniques to reduce write energy consumption. These techniques worked based on two important points about 
PCRAM cells. First, independency and addressability in PCRAMs and 
second, free PCM blocks. Based on manipulation content technique which 
writes new data based on last data and number of changes and content aware 
placement technique which writes new data based on free blocks and 
similarity of computed signature of new data and free blocks we presented a 
hybrid method which use two above techniques. In fact, in this method, 
choosing free block for writing new data is not only based on original data, 
but also is dependent to inverse of original data. The results shows that in 
hybrid method we achieved to about %65 overall improvement and about 
%15 improvement against content aware placement technique.
 
In this Project we represent two following papers:
